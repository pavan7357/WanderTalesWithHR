The paper focuses on estimating the "hallucination rate" in generative AI, particularly for in- context learning (ICL). In ICL, generative models predict responses based on datasets and questions. The study defines "hallucinations" as responses that are unlikely based on the modelâ€™s underlying mechanisms. The authors introduce a method to estimate the probability of generating a hallucination by evaluating the log probability of model responses. The method is tested using large language models in synthetic and natural language tasks.
